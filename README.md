# challenge-1-code-refactor

## Description

In this weeks challenge assignment I examined a source code. In the source code, I provided HTML semantic elements and had it follow a logical structure. I also provided attribites to the code and made it follow a sequential order. To make the code more accessible I added to the images in the code, meaning I added "alt attributes" to complete the code of each image. The last thing I did to the code was provide a concise title within the "title element" of the code. This code helped me apply all the things that I learned so far. I was able to understand and make sense of the code, orgainize it, and make it easier to follow.
